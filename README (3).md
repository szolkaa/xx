<summary id="1-xml-generator">1. XML Generator</summary>

1.1 Load the .xml ESI file from the manufacturer.   
![1.1](images/1.1.png)

1.2 Replace the names of the HAL pins (PDO).    
It replaces the name modes of operation → opmode and a few others; all pin names can be found in the servodriver manual for example: fixed pdo mapping chapter, 6000 group object dictionary. 
![1.2](images/1.2.png)

1.3 Reduce PDOs to CSP essential.   
Keeps the first output group and the first input PDO, keeps essential PDOs for CSP mode; if you want to use CSV mode, target velocity is kept instead of target position. The text can be edited manually. 
![1.3](images/1.3.png)

1.4 Duplicate the slave.   
Each click duplicates the text </slave... </slave> and increments the slave index in numerical order.

2.1 Load ethercat-conf.xml   
After loading ethercat-conf.xml, all PDOs available in the selected file will appear, and in the HAL generation window on the right side, the configuration initialization section will appear.
LinuxCNC executes the configuration line by line, initializing modules, setting parameters, and preparing the system for motion control.
Among others, in this line: "loadusr -W lcec_conf ethercat-conf.xml", the PDOs from the file with the prefix lcec will be loaded into the HAL module running in LinuxCNC’s internal memory in real time, where all signal connections between devices and the control system are created. 
![2.1](images/2.1.png)

2.2. load cia402.comp   
The .comp file is parsed into pins and parameters; most of the suggested pins are automatically matched. The pos_scale value should be selected based on the encoder and the stroke per revolution
![2.2](images/2.2.png)

2.3. Axis selection    
During selection, a specific machine axis (X, Y, Y2, Z, etc.) is assigned to the selected EtherCAT slave, and parameters common to all axes are set. Based on this, the program automatically connects the selected axis to the appropriate control input. 
The HAL file preview is updated in real time, making it easy to understand which value is responsible for what and how the individual settings are related to each other while changing parameters.

<summary id="3-ini-generator">3. INI Generator</summary>

3.1 Load HAL   
The HAL file is treated here as a description of logical connections. In LinuxCNC, an abstract logical model is created that corresponds to how LinuxCNC sees the machine.
Here it is similar, except that the file is only analyzed. The program checks whether the servos share common signals and whether the set of signals is consistent.
The machine moves within a closed space, and homing in this configuration is intended for absolute encoders, which most often use soft limits [MIN_LIMIT] [MAX_LIMIT] often without the use of physical limit switch inputs and I/O modules. For this reason, before using automatic configuration, proper installation of the CIA402 homing component is required.
(linuxcnc-dev, cia402_homecomp.comp, cia402_homecomp.h, basecomp.comp) 
![3.1](images/3.1.png)

3.2.Gantry mode   
In other words, using two motors in one plane.
After switching to gantry mode, the following arrangement is created:        
`1 : 1                                      Gantry    `       
`Axis X → joint.0                           Axis X → joint.0    `      
`Axis Y → joint.1                           Axis Y → joint.1 , joint.2    `  
`Axis Z → joint.2                           Axis Z →  joint.3    `      
`Axis A → joint.3    `   
And the parameters in [KINS] and [TRAJ] change dynamically and later define the recognition of the mode by LinuxCNC during loading.

5.1 Operating State  
The master must be active before the slaves, because in EtherCAT the master performs the role of synchronization and managing the communication cycle. The slaves cannot initiate transmission or synchronize with the bus on their own; they wait until the master starts the data cycle and distributes the timing. If the master is not active, the slaves will be in a waiting or error state, because they will not receive the reference clock or control commands. In many cases, re-initialization will not occur. Therefore, powering on the slaves or connecting the cable with already powered slaves should properly happen after starting the LinuxCNC GUI.

# 2. From LinuxCNC 2.9.8 Debian 13 Installation via IGH EtherCat Master to the First Motor Movement    
        
      
 
<details>   
<summary id="1.-LinuxCNC-Installation">1. LinuxCNC Installation</summary>    
  
    
1.1 The installation applies to LinuxCNC 2.9.8 Debian 13 Trixie      
Download the image:        
https://www.linuxcnc.org/iso/linuxcnc_2.9.8-amd64.hybrid.iso     
Mount the ISO to a pendrive, e.g., using the Rufus program    
      
1.2 If Linux will be a second system, you can first create unallocated space on the disk in Windows:       
- Press Win + X and select Disk Management.    
- Shrink the partition (if you want to keep data)   
- In the Disk Management window, find the partition you want to shrink.    
- Right-click it and select Shrink Volume.      
- Enter by how many MB you want to shrink the partition     
– that much space will become unallocated.   
Click Shrink.     
         
1.3 Change the boot order in BIOS to set the pendrive as first.    
After booting from the pendrive, select install LinuxCNC   
Manual disk selection     
Partition selection: one EFI system partition is required, a swap partition 4–16 GB, and an ext4 partition with the mount point /     
Use as: EFI system partition     
Use as: swap partition 4–16 GB       
Use as: ext4 partition with mount point /     
*If the EFI partition already exists, select use as system partition and do not format.   
*The EFI partition must contain a Debian entry for the system to boot from the disk    
     
1.4 If GRUB does not want to install, choose Finish without a bootloader   
However, in this situation, leave the pendrive so that Linux can boot again.   
And select at the top: Live LinuxCNC   
To install GRUB via the Internet   
     
1.5 In Live Linux    
connect to the Internet via the toolbar.    
     
![b1.5](images/b1.5.png)      
     
Then open the terminal and enter the following commands in order to enable downloading via the Internet:    
    
```sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf```    
```sudo mount --bind /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf```    
Check the Internet:    
```ping -c 3 deb.debian.org```    
    
1.6 Mounting and operating on system partitions to add an entry to EFI    
Check the partitions:     
lsblk -f    

![b1.6](images/b1.6.png)        
   
Mount the EFI partition and the /ext4 partition by their names, in this case:    
```sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p7 /mnt/```           Partition /EXT4     
```sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi```   Partition  EFI      
        
Mount the system directories in order:    
```sudo mount --bind /dev  /mnt/dev```    
```sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc```    
```sudo mount --bind /sys  /mnt/sys```    
```sudo mount --bind /run  /mnt/run```    
    
Now GRUB installation:    
Enter Debian (ch root)      
```sudo chroot /mnt```     
The prompt should appear as: root@debian:/#     
     
Install GRUB       
```apt update```      
```apt install grub-efi-amd64 efibootmgr```       
      
Install GRUB to EFI:     
```grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=Debian```     
     
Optional, Generate the menu    
```update-grub``` 
         
Exit and clean up   
```exit```    
```sudo umount -R /mnt```  
      
```reboot```    
     
Now the entry in EFI (/boot/efi/EFI/Debian/) has already been created, Linux will boot normally.     
End of installation – remove the pendrive; at startup, you can access the boot manager by pressing, e.g., F7, depending on the BIOS.

The network card can be connected to the IGH EtherCAT master if it is recognized by it.      
Supported cards are mainly Intel with the igb  igc 1000 or 1000e driver.       
This ensures greater compatibility with real-time operations and allows the card to work exclusively under the control of EtherCAT.     
       
Checking the type of network card driver in the Kernel.        
```sudo apt update```       
```sudo apt install ethtool```       
Find the name of your card          
```ip a```      
     
![b.7.1](images/b.7.1.png)

```lspci -nn | grep -i ethernet```     
       
![b7.2](images/b7.2.png)          
        
If the network card driver is named igb, igc, 1000, 1000e, or any of the others listed in ethercat.conf, we will try to connect it to the master instead of using the generic mode.     
       
```sudo geany /etc/ethercat.conf```    
   
In this case, replace generic with:    
    
DEVICE_MODULES="igb"    
      
Save and close    
        
```sudo systemctl stop ethercat```     
```sudo systemctl start ethercat```    
     
We check whether the card is Native/attached

*Note that the parser in the XML generator has been adjusted only for Lichuan ESI.xml files due to the lack of ESI files from other manufacturers. In the future, support for a greater variety will be added.
It is still possible to use the HAL and INI generators with a fixed ethercat-conf.xml.

*Last stege Proposed configuration in ini generator and also 3 homing Cutom joints in hal generator is for absolute encoders with use of softlimits therefore before using automatic configuration, proper installation of the CIA402 homing component is required.
